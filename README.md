# DE-130817
Two-Way Radio Link Receiver Modul

this is a receiver for DE-110817 transmitter, with a secure radio link to control the concrete pumps. 8 digital inputs are transmitted from the receiver to the transmitter, the PWM driver temperature of 65 degrees Celsius sends a warning to the transmitter, 80 degrees Celsius switches off and blocks the PWM and relay outputs except the oil pump and bypass valve controls. the supply voltage is also monitored. The 433MHz HC-12 radio modules are more than enough range for a stable radio link. if the transmitter does not confirm the transmitter packet longer than 500ms, the receiver switches off the outputs and an LED signal is activated on the transmitter.
